# honey

_A sweet dashboard I use on my homeserver with some self-hosted stuff..._

honey is written in **pure** `HTML` `CSS` `JS` so dynamic backend or special webserver configuration is not required.
It works out-of-the-box as all operations are done client-side.

## üöÄ Installation

### üï∏Ô∏è On existing webserver

1. Download latest prebuilt archive from **[Releases](https://github.com/dani3l0/honey/releases)**.

2. Extract downloaded archive to your webserver root.

3. You're done!


### üêã via Docker

```
docker run -p 4173:4173 -v /path/to/config:/app/dist/config:ro ghcr.io/dani3l0/honey:latest
```

- `-p 4173:4173` - exposes HTTP port to your machine
- `-v /path/to/config:/app/dist/config:ro` - mounts config directory to your local filesystem in read-only mode (we don't need write permissions)

If you have custom icons or background images, you can freely put them in `config` dir.
Just remember to provide valid URLs (with `/config` prefix).


## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Configuration file is located at `config/config.json`.

YAML format is also supported.
In this case, file should be named `config.yaml` and placed in `config` directory as well.
If both formats are present, JSON will be used.


### üì± Tweaking the user interface

The following keys are available under `ui` section.
Some of them are listed in _Settings_ page and can be customized by end-user.

| Key name				| Description																																	| in Settings	|
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `name`				| Name shown at the main screen and the tab title.																								|		‚ùå		|
| `desc`				| Short description shown under title at the main screen.																						|		‚ùå		|
| `icon`				| Icon shown at the main screen and as site's favicon.																							|		‚ùå		|
| `wallpaper`			| Background image visible when dark mode is disabled.																							|		‚ùå		|
| `wallpaper_dark`		| Background image visible when dark mode is enabled.																							|		‚ùå		|
| `dark_mode`			| Tells whether dark mode is enabled by default.																								|		‚úÖ		|
| `open_new_tab`		| Tells whether clicking on a service will open it in new tab by default.																		|		‚úÖ		|
| `blur`				| Tells whether card background blur is enabled by default.																						|		‚úÖ		|
| `animations`			| Tells whether UI animations are enabled by default.																							|		‚úÖ		|


### üîó Adding custom services

`services` section is an array containing objects. Object's structure looks like this:

| Key name			| Description																	|
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`			| Your service's name.															|
| `desc`			| Short description shown under service's name.									|
| `href`			| URL address of your service. It is directly passed to `<a>` tag.				|
| `icon`			| Path to an icon of your service.												|

### Example configuration:

```json
{
  "ui": {
    "name": "honey",
    "desc": "Nice and sweet place for all your self-hosted services.",
    "icon": "img/icon.png",
    "wallpaper": "img/background.jpg",
    "wallpaper_dark": "img/background-dark.jpg",
    "dark_mode": false,
    "open_new_tab": false,
    "blur": true,
    "animations": true
  },
  "services": [
    {
      "name": "CalDav",
      "desc": "Simple CalDav server for calendar sync between various devices.",
      "href": "caldav",
      "icon": "img/preview/caldav.png"
    }
  ]
}
```

or 

```yaml
ui:
  name: honey
  desc: Nice and sweet place for all your self-hosted services.
  icon: img/icon.png
  wallpaper: img/background.jpg
  wallpaper_dark: img/background-dark.jpg
  dark_mode: false
  open_new_tab: false
  blur: true
  animations: true

services:
  - name: CalDav
    desc: Simple CalDav server for calendar sync between various devices.
    href: caldav
    icon: img/preview/caldav.png
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

honey is built on top of [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/). This tool allows faster development and offers various optimizations.

How to prepare a development environment:

```
# Download the source code
git clone https://github.com/dani3l0/honey && cd honey

# Install required modules
npm i
```


### üóº Live server

**For coding.** This will spin up a HTTP server on **[localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/)**. Each time source file is saved, UI will automatically hot-reload so there is no need for `ALT+TAB` and `F5`.

```
npm run dev
```


### üèóÔ∏è Build

**Prepare project for production.** This command will link and optimize project assets to take less space and require less bandwith. Prebuilt assets will be stored in `dist` directory and are ready to be put in a webserver root.

```
npm run build
```


## ü§ù Credits

Of course, some third-party resources are used in this project. I kanged them for self-hosting, easier development and to avoid compatibility issues.

- **[Material Icons](https://github.com/materialos/android-icon-pack/)**, for app icons at _Services_ page

- **[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)**, for material icons on buttons and Quicksand font

- **honey icon** - random icon found in DuckDuckGo Images

- **Wallpapers** - very nice background images kanged from [wallhaven](https://wallhaven.cc/)
